On a Mac to open your terminal you can use the spotlight search and search *terminal*.

## To create the directory

1. You first want to begin by checking where you are in the terminal by typing ```pwd```
and that stands for print working directory. 
This will show an output of exactly where you are in the terminal. 

2. To return to the home directory type ```cd```
and that stands for change directory. 
3. Once we are in the home directory, we need to create a new directory by typing ```mkdir``` followed by the directory name. ```mkdir``` stands for make directory. We can check to ensure the director was made successfully by typing ```ls``` Once you see the directory you had just created you can confirm it was created successfully. ```ls``` stands for list. You have just created your first directory in the terminal. 

### Creating a new file
1. To create a file in the newly made directory we just made we first need to change into that directory by typing ```cd directory-name``` and we should now see next to the arrow the name of the the file we changed into. Now to create a new file inside of the directory we need to type ```touch name-of-the-file```
2. to confirm we created the file successfully we need to type to following command ```ls``` and we will see the files inside of the directory we are currently in.
